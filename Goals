Main goals
Explore and describe the data. Visualize and comment on selected examples.
Describe at least one reference paper where anomaly detection is performed and evaluated on the suggested MVTec AD dataset.
What makes anomaly detection different from common classification problems?
Train your own (variational) autoencoder model to reconstruct one object class. Which class did you choose? How did you define your model?
Use at least one other model. You are free to choose a pre-trained model.
Classify images with higher reconstruction errors as an anomaly. Investigate your results based on different thresholds. Perform a visual inspection of selected examples.
Does one model perform clearly better?
Define other possible choices to define an anomaly, based on your literature search.

Optional
How can you tend to all classes of the dataset at once
Use a method to explain why an image was classified as anomalous depending on your model of choice, e.g. attention maps, Grad-CAM.


What has been done:
Train your own (variational) autoencoder model to reconstruct one object class. Which class did you choose? How did you define your model?
Classify images with higher reconstruction errors as an anomaly. Investigate your results based on different thresholds. Perform a visual inspection of selected examples.
Use at least one other model. You are free to choose a pre-trained model.
Does one model perform clearly better? No sadly not (swap out conv for VAE)
